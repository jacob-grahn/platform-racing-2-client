# Platform Racing 2 Haxe/OpenFL Port TODO

This file tracks only unfinished work. The target is a 1:1 port of the original
Flash client, not a compatible remake: behavior, protocol,
screen flow, layout, animation, sound, and failure states should match the AS3
and XFL sources. Completed work belongs in git history and `README.md`.

## Parity Rules

- Treat `flash/**/*.as` and `flash/platform-racing-2-xfl/` as the behavioral and
  visual specification. Do not silently simplify a workflow because the happy
  path works.
- Temporary drawings, record-only actions, harness redirects, hard-coded data,
  and unsupported buttons are parity gaps and must remain listed here.
- A task is complete only when the real user flow works. Rendering the art or
  recording the requested action is not completion.
- Run only the related test cases for your change, the full suite is a bit slow
